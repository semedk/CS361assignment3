This is a currency converter. 
The goal is to input a specific amount, a type of currency that describes the input and a type of currency that describes the output you want. 
In order to use my currency converter, you'll need to input all of these values.
In order to do so, you need to hit 1, 2, and 3 accordingly (based on what the initial prompt gives) and input those values.
You'll know if you've gotten through all of them by seeing what values are displayed when looking at the prompt (The default is N/A and 0)

Once you're finished, enter in 7 to submit those values.
Hitting 7 will effectively be you 'requesting' for the currency conversion
In order to 'recieve' all you would need to do is wait until the currency conversion is done and the message is sent
